Draw a line connecting the current year-month-day-hour-minute-second-millisecond. Aided by code, it is possible to animate in the ["now"](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530030.500-the-time-illusion-how-your-brain-creates-now/), what does this mean for animation?. This sketch is a starting point for considering not only "real-time" animation, but (perhaps more interesting), explore that ephemeral state in flux where all that one has accumulated in life suddenly has a chance to act upon oneself, the rational mind has no time to consider anymore, the "now" is like an epic collision of all that we are, yet it manifests itself organized, mundane, often irrelevant.
