- Table of Contents
- Introduction
- Digital media language, data and algorithms as metaphor for life experiences that are complex. The potential for new forms in animated drawings lies in the understanding of the digital paradigm, where the physical state of film or even digital rendering is replaced with a modular ephemeral state of bits in computers. What is at stake for narrative and aesthetics in hand drawn animation?

Modularity

Technique

This research stems from the empirical question: how to represent the experience of recalling a memory in permanent flux? That is, the process in which one remembers a particular life experience, but the picture painted in the mind and the feelings it evokes, varies depending on the present state of the self. 

 The motivation for this research is twofold; primarily I seek to develop an artistic body of work that embodies the feeling of 


The long lasting metaphor to define animation is rooted in its etymology. From the Latin anima or animus, animation is the art form of giving life to the inanimate. 
How this illusion of life is created through moving drawings, paintings, sculptures or digital imagery is intrinsically related to the technologies that allow for the animated image to take form.  


This dissertation proposes a new approach to “hand drawn”   animation, introduced here as “Data Driven Drawings”.  The goal is to present a series of techniques and a conceptual framework that has allowed me to develop animated films that represent aspects of life that behave as complex system. Primarily looking at the experience of serial autobiography. I will contest that emerging digital technologies allow for animation art form to expand its long lasting metaphor of the illusion of life, into the illusion of life understood under the lens of its definition provided in complexity science. Opening novel forms of representation for representing the nonlinear, self-organizing and chaotic structures present in the experience of life and what makes us human. 


This is the result of an artistic endeavor in which I seek to expand the long lasting metaphor of animation as the illusion of life, to the illusion of life as a complex system. That is, life as 

, provides new possibilities for the animated art form to expand the ways in which life is represented. 
 
The premise of this investigation is grounded in the empirical question: How can I create an artistic representation of life as a complex system? 

Animation = “Illusion of life”
Data Driven = modular paradigm of how computer work with information.
Drawings = the human, “I”.
DDD = Illusion of I in the flow of information.

Data driven drawings is the result of an investigation that reevaluates the definition of animation as an “illusion of life”, a long lasting metaphor rooted in it’s own etymology.   
connection between the etymology of the word “animation” and the art form that is named after it. 
Pack it all here, this is the premise, then say what the goal became and the conclusion of this.

Even though the following paragraphs are intended to provide conceptual clarity to the previous statement, I have personally come to understand the premise of the present research from reflecting on how I have . 
Since I did my first animated exercises back in the early 2000’s, I was convinced that those drawings that inertly sited on my desk suddenly seem to be alive once they moved on the screen. 

That is, the connection between the idea of imparting life to things that are otherwise inanimate 

The following paragraphs will provide clarity to the premise that has motivated this research. 

If animation is the form of art by which objects that are otherwise inanimate (drawings, painting, sculpture, digital images ) are given “life”, new digital technologies are opening avenues for this 

In order to define this new form of animation, it is important to state the different domains in which it is rooted, the formal relationships between those existing domains and the implications of combining them into a new form of animated cinema. 

Within the tradition of animated films, data driven drawings stands at the edge of what a “film” means in the present state of filmmaking using digital media.

## The Sublime

In the literature about data representation it is common to find a bold claim. Data visualization promises to reduce the manifestation of complex phenomena into a scale in which it is possible to reason about them. This is true, but only partially in the sense that the process between abstraction to knowledge, the phenomena can be abstracted down, but when it is unpacked again in the mind of the viewer, *it can expand back to its original scale*, producing in us the experience of the sublime, one that is beyond reason, provokes an emotional reaction. From early theories on the sublime, Burke associated such emotional response with fear and a sense of anxiety. He described events such as attempting to fully comprehend the vastness of the alps, the ocean or outer space. Trying to pack this information into ones mind overwhelms our reasoning capacity. This NASA data driven animation takes a vast data set describing the movement of elements in space from the big bang to present time. That means the entire time of the universe. Abstracting this to numbers help us reason, we can deduce that the universe is about ## billion years old. This in relation to time as we regularly measure it such as our own age in years, gives us some sort of perspective of the scale in which the universe has existed. The visualization serves other purposes as well, it reveals the patterns in how stellar bodies move around their orbits and shift through time, the birth, life and death of stars, the effects of these on the neighboring bodies, etc. So much information is packed on it, things reason acts upon us, the phenomena is reduced to that scale in which we can deduce clear evidence and that comes with great intellectual satisfaction. The problem is that not every reading of this representation might be the same, as a non scientist, by standard viewer of this animation, knowing that in is produced with this particular data set, my reaction is more emotional than intellectual, is all life contained in there? it all seems so fragile, ephemeral, my own life is so small within this context, i imagine ancestors whom I never met, they live their lives and experienced in perhaps a similar fashion than me, as a sometimes long other times short sequence of events. People I love and died are part of this natural flow of time, these events seem more dramatic in my mind as they seem to play in the time of the universe. The experience with all these questions at play becomes more confusing, fear acts upon me because I can't fully understand how time works in the scale of time of the universe. Reason surrenders to internalize this information and the unpacking goes beyond, back to the sublime, I surrender to it. 

The goal of this chapter is to contextualize the intended objective of data representation practices within an understanding of the sublime. I will bring forward the most compelling arguments and practical examples that favor the idea that data representation is a tool capable of taking particular phenomena that normally correspond to the sublime, into a scale in which us humans can reason over these events and even understand them. I will draw connections between these proposed arguments and an ongoing discourse of the sublime. By doing so, I intend to arrive at the following proposition: data representation       
  
unravel the intrinsic relationship between data representation as an art form and the ideas of the sublime. I will contest that even though some data representations successfully 

In the context of data representation theories , one of the prevailing objectives is to reduce the gap between the unknown and our understanding. Not any kind of unknown, but specifically complex phenomena. Events within the realm of our experience  that are so vast or have so many parts to them, that our intuition alone finds its limits at any attempt to wholly comprehend. Within this line of reasoning, data representation as an art form is intrinsically related to the long  
 ought to challenge the boundless limits of 

successful data representations should allow us to reason about the 
 such complex phenomena      

Within this perspective, the promise of what data representation can achieve and the tradition of the sublime are intrinsically connected. But 

Lev Manovich (2008) is the first one to draw a parallel between the current role of what he calls data visualization artists and the sublime, but his bold proposition that data visualization aims to be the anti-sublime will be contested here, not as untrue, since there are cases in which data visualization does successfully reduces complex phenomena into discernible scales, but as only partially true for certain forms in which the goal is specifically that to inform. 

“If Romantic artists thought of certain phenomena and effects as unrepresentable, as going beyond the limits of human senses and reason, data visualization artists aim at precisely the opposite: to map such phenomena into a representation whose scale is comparable to the scales of human perception and cognition.” (2008, p. 8)

 
Therefore can only be perceived, and potentially comprehended, through the macroscopic view provided by mapping information.
